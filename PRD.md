## 🧠 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Product Title:

**Automated Life Organizer (ALO)**

### Document Status:

Draft v1.0 – May 2025

---

## 🌀 1. Purpose

To design and build an **AI-powered Automated Life Organizer** that manages users' schedules, appointments, tasks, and reminders in a proactive, intelligent, and emotionally aware manner. The system should reduce cognitive load by providing **context-aware suggestions**, **seamless integration with existing tools**, and **nudges** that feel intuitive rather than robotic.

---

## 🌍 2. Target Audience

* Remote professionals and creatives
* Neurodivergent individuals (e.g., ADHD, depression recovery)
* Students managing coursework and personal growth
* Individuals overwhelmed with traditional calendar/to-do apps

---

## 🎯 3. Goals & Objectives

### Functional Goals:

* Seamlessly **collect**, **organize**, and **remind** users of tasks and events.
* Use **natural language processing (NLP)** to allow users to add entries conversationally.
* Provide **intelligent prioritization** based on urgency, context, and emotional state.
* Sync with external calendars (Google, Outlook), apps (Notion, Todoist), and assistants (Google Assistant, Alexa).
* Proactively **reschedule** missed or delayed tasks based on user behavior and constraints.

### Non-Functional Goals:

* Ensure data privacy and user control.
* Provide a **calm, non-judgmental UX** that reduces overwhelm.
* Mobile-first design; web version optional.

## 🛠️ 5. Architecture Overview

### High-Level Components:

* **Frontend** (React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile)
* **Backend API** (FastAPI or Node.js)
* **Database** (PostgreSQL for tasks, Redis for real-time reminders)
* **AI/NLP Layer** (OpenRouter or Hugging Face integration for intent parsing)
* **Calendar/Tool Integrations** (Google Calendar API, Notion API, Zapier endpoints)

### Optional Agentic Upgrade (Phase 2):

* Add memory-based LLM assistant (e.g., personal scheduling agent using LangChain or AutoGen)
* Temporal awareness: "I haven't journaled this week, maybe now?"

---

## 🔁 6. User Journeys

### Scenario A: Add Task via Voice

1. User speaks: “Remind me to drink water every 2 hours starting 10 am tomorrow.”
2. NLP parses task → creates recurring reminders → syncs with notifications.
3. App confirms: “Got it! I’ll remind you every 2 hours from 10am to 6pm.”

### Scenario B: Rescheduling Missed Tasks

1. User misses a task due at 9am.
2. App suggests: “You missed your workout. Want to do it after lunch?”
3. One-tap rescheduling.

### Scenario C: Mood-Aware Nudging

1. User rates mood: “Low energy.”
2. App reprioritizes: shifts intense tasks to later, promotes light/self-care tasks now.
