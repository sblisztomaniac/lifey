## 1. Development Workflow

### 1.1 Task Management
- All work is tracked in the project backlog
- Tasks are classified as: Feature, Bug, or Chore
- Use Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8) for story point estimation

### 1.2 Development Flow
1. **Start** the top unstarted story from the backlog
2. **Branch** from `main` using naming convention: `{type}/{id}-description`
   - `feature/123-add-user-auth`
   - `bug/456-fix-login-error`
   - `chore/789-update-deps`
3. **Develop** using TDD approach:
   - Write failing tests (Red)
   - Implement minimal code to pass (Green)
   - Refactor (Refactor)
4. **Commit** frequently with descriptive messages
5. **Push** to remote and create PR when ready for review
6. **Review** and address feedback
7. **Merge** when approved and all checks pass
8. **Deploy** through CI/CD pipeline

## 2. Branching Strategy

### 2.1 Branch Types
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `staging` - Pre-production testing
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bug/*` - Bug fixes
- `chore/*` - Maintenance tasks

### 2.2 Branch Naming
```
{type}/{ticket-id}-{description}
```
Example: `feature/123-add-user-authentication`

## 3. Commit Guidelines

### 3.1 Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### 3.2 Commit Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc. (no code change)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### 3.3 Examples
```
feat(auth): add Google OAuth login
fix(api): resolve 500 error on user creation
docs: update API documentation
```

## 4. Code Style

### 4.1 General
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use single quotes for strings
- Always use semicolons
- Trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
- Use ES6+ features where applicable

### 4.2 Naming Conventions
- Variables/Functions: `camelCase`
- Classes/Constructors: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private members: `_privateMethod`
- Files: `kebab-case.js`

### 4.3 File Structure
```
src/
  components/    # Reusable UI components
  pages/         # Page components
  hooks/         # Custom React hooks
  utils/         # Utility functions
  services/      # API services
  store/         # State management
  styles/        # Global styles
  types/         # TypeScript type definitions
  tests/         # Test files
  __mocks__/     # Test mocks
```

## 5. Testing Standards

### 5.1 Test Structure
- Unit tests: `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`
- Test files live next to the code they test
- Use `describe` and `it` blocks
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

### 5.2 Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Test both success and error cases

### 5.3 Testing Tools

- React Testing Library for components
- Cypress for E2E testing
- MSW for API mocking
